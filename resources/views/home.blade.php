      <h1>What is Digital Harrisburg?</h1>
      <br>
      <p>This website is devoted to the Digital Harrisburg Initiative, a digital public humanities project,
        or series of projects, created by students and faculty of Messiah College and Harrisburg University 
        of Science and Technology that explore the history and culture of the Harrisburg area. The Digital Harrisburg
        Initiative is intended to provide a public resource for learning about and understanding Harrisburg, build 
        community and institutional connections across the region, and deepen students understanding of history, the 
        humanities, and digital technology. This website and blog is the public outlet for that initiative and is populated 
        with content created by the students and faculty from these institutions.</p>
